# Exercise 4 
## Demonstrate the use of all types of loops in python:
1. While Loop <br>
`Mini password cracker simulator which checks a set of passwords against a randomly chosen password from this set.`
2. For Loop <br>
`Password strength checker - user enters his password and the program tells if it matches the criteria (lenght (>7), has upper, lower characters, numbers and special characters).`
3. Range Loop <br>
`Ran out of ideas so decided to create a math related task - program prints numbers in a user chosen range that are palindromes (reads the same way forwards as backwards).`
